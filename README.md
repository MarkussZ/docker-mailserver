# docker-mailserver-armhf

Docker-mailserver for Raspberry Pi / armv7 devices.

Just some little changes I put together which were provided by (@HolyGuacamole)[https://github.com/HolyGuacamole] in this [issue](https://github.com/tomav/docker-mailserver/issues/348)

You will have to build this yourself.

```
docker build -t tvial/docker-mailserver:2.1 .
```
